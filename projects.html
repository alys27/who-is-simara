                        This is our first project in Principles of Information Systems course. My team was Team 11. In this project, we constructed AND, OR, and NOT gates. For one extra point, we collabrated with Team 7 to construct NAND gate. These all were successful, but second extra point was not fully completed.

                        This is our second project in Principles of Information Systems course. In this project, we introduced ADA University to school students first through a presentation, and then we taught them basics of programming using BugArena. It was a fun and interactive session where students learned to create simple programs by snapping together code blocks. This project was dedicated to AI and programming awareness week.

                        This is my only individual project for Principles of Information Systems course. In this project, I have created my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing manner. It serves as a platform to present my work to potential employers and collaborators. It is the most challenging project I have undertaken so far. I hope I can get full and extra points for it!
