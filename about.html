                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My story began on the 20th of March, 2007, on a rainy evening. Now I am 18 years old and living in Baku. I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.ada.edu.az/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ada-university">ADA University</a>.<br><br>
                    I enjoy drawing, even though I have never taken any formal courses, and I also play the guitar—though not as confidently as I draw. I am an introverted person and tend to keep my opinions, ideas, and personal thoughts to myself. At first glance, I may seem more serious than I actually am, but if you ask my friends, the word you will hear most often is “jokeful.”<br><br>
                    If you would like to learn more about me, just scroll down—I have shared a few things here that I do not usually share so easily. 😊

                    I am deeply interested in art, music, and programming. These passions inspire my creativity 
                    and shape how I approach both technology and life. You can explore more about my hobbies below.

                        <p>Me and my handsome guitar. My favorite musician may be raper, but I find myself in calm and peaceful songs. And playing these songs on my guitar is one of the most healing activity for me.</p>

                        <p>I am interested in creating algorithms and solving problems through code and technology since 7th grade. In this era, we are taught basics of C++ and Python through mathematical problems in eolymp(I have solved 350+ problems 😎). And this is current screenshot from my pc.</p>
